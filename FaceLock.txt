Facial recognition solution to open doors.

Plan:

High Res Web Cam to record face picture.
Raspberry Pi to process the data.
Using Raspbian as an OS
Using libface for the face recognition.

Magnetic door lock with network connection.

Email sent to Administrator for unlock/lock process, data saved in entry.log

Raspberry Login

User/Pass and Google Authentication (new code every 60seconds)
Access locked down to MAC Address.

Database = MongoDB?

Programming Language:
